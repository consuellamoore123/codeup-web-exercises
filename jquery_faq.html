            <dt>Where can I find a park map?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                You can view maps on specific park websites or find national park, National Park System, National
                Trails System, and other maps.
            </dd>

            <dt>How do I make reservations for camping/lodging in national parks?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov. Not all parks participate in this service;
                many campgrounds are first come, first served. For more information on specific camping and
                lodging services offered at the park(s) of your interest, please check specific park websites.
                You can also learn more about camping in national parks and find a map of parks with camping
                opportunities.
            </dd>

            <dt>Can I bring my pet to a national park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                Some national parks welcome petsâ€”in developed areas, on many trails and campgrounds, and in
                some lodging facilities. Learn more about pets in parks.
            </dd>

            <dt>Can I bring my service dog to a national park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                Yes, service dogs are legally permitted anywhere in a park that visitors can go. Learn
                more about service animals in national parks, including the difference between service
                animals and emotional support animals.
            </dd>

            <dt>What do I need to know about driving off road in national parks?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                Before you head out, check with the national parks that you intend to visit. In many
                national parks, off-road driving is illegal. Where off-road driving is allowed, the
                National Park Service regulates it.
            </dd>

            <dt>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain
                park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee.
                Entrance fee sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to
                your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number
                of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes
                that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to
                the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer
                passes). Learn more about the America the Beautiful - The National Parks and
                Federal Recreational Lands Pass.
            </dd>
            <dt>What government agency oversees the National Park Service?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                The National Park Service is a bureau of the Department of the Interior.
                Directly overseeing its operation is the department's Assistant Secretary
                for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
            </dd>
    <dt>How do I apply for a job with the National Park Service?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">
        National Park Service jobs, including both permanent and seasonal positions, are listed on USAJOBs. Learn more
        about working for us, including opportunities for students and volunteers and tips for applying for jobs.
